# Number Guesser

### Project Takeaways:

This project was the first to introduce event listeners. I gained a bunch of experience using these listeners for different events on different elements throughout the page, and tying the logic tools/syntax we've learned to write the programming that makes the app function. 

### Gameplay
- Guess a number between the specified range (default: 0-100)
- Levels 1-5: Range will expand by -10, +10.
- Levels 6+: Range will expand by -20, +20.
- Presss `enter` to submit guess.
- Press `escape` to clear guess input.
- Enter custom Min and Max values to tailor the game to yourself. (Editing the Min or Max after the game has started will reset the game)
